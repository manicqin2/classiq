  title: Quantum Circuit Task Queue API
  description: |
    REST API for submitting quantum circuit execution tasks and retrieving results.

    This is a stubbed implementation providing foundational endpoints for parallel development.
    Actual task execution and persistence will be added in subsequent features.

    **Key Features:**
    - Submit quantum circuits for async execution
    - Query task status and results
    - Health check for monitoring

    **Constitution Compliance:**
    - Principle 3 (Observable): Correlation IDs for request tracing
    - Principle 7 (Separation of Concerns): API layer does not execute tasks
    - Principle 8 (Production Patterns): RESTful design, standard HTTP codes
  version: 1.0.0

      summary: Submit quantum circuit task
      description: |
        Submit a quantum circuit for asynchronous execution. Returns a unique task ID
        that can be used to query execution status and results.

        **Stub Behavior:** Task is not actually executed or persisted. A UUID is generated
        and returned for testing client integration.
